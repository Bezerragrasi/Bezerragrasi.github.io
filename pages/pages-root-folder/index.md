    <p>I am a Research Software Engineer, focusing on Computational Mechanics, at the Research Computing, University of Leeds, UK. I have a PhD in Theoretical Physics, a Master degree in Condensed Matter Physics and a Licenciatura degree in Physics. For contact details, please see my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/cv">CV & Contact</a> page.</p>

    <p>Most of my research focuses on the development of numerical simulation of complex systems in different areas, like simulations of fluid dynamics, nanoscopic friction, predator and prey relationship, and stock market. More recently, I also have become interested on understand and explain social systems, like flows of people around cities, in particular using agent-based modelling and data assimilation techniques.</p>

    <p>I also have extensive teaching experience. I worked as an undergraduate Substitute Professor at Federal Institute Catarinense (Brazil). I also did three educational internships, working with non-traditional science education and tutoring students who have disabilities. </p>
